# Deep Learning Library

A deep learning library implementing a variety of standard models, optimizers, loss functions, and activation functions. This work is based off of and directly incorporates code from Joel Grus's [Livecoding Madness](https://joelgrus.com/2017/12/04/livecoding-madness-building-a-deep-learning-library/).
